# FAQ
### <i>What is this?</i>
### UncBuild is just Ishiiruka FPM 3.1.2 but with the latest P+ update included as the sd.raw file. It's simply the old version Dolphin but with the latest P+ patch pre-installed! I also tweaked a few icons, names, etc. but otherwise no actual coding went into this, this is just to make it an easy download for the Unc's out there.

### <i>Can I netplay vs someone on Mainline?</i>
### No, in order to netplay you and your friend must both be playing on the same Dolphin revision. You can check which revision your own by going to Help > About in Dolphin and looking at the revision number.
